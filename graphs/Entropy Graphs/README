Note about RedCanary Entropy Histogram Plots:
Entropy histogram graphs have the most distinction when taking the top 1000 results
this make be as a result of Alexa's top 1 million being organized in a way that later domain
entries resemble more malicious domain names.

Based on the graphs, especially the phish tank histograms the entropy scoring should be weighted more.
It is performing well in separating bad and good domains.
Note that the entropy score can still exceed 1 since the max scores for phishtanks produce high entropy scores
above the max score we saw from our elasticsearch query results

Think about using the standardization, for now we just have normalized values that sometimes exceed 1.
